  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Our project is to find patterns in the NYC Education Lottery; we are interested in the income levels of people buying lottery tickets and the success of the schools in those areas. We will look at the relationships of where those tickets are sold with poverty rates, city crime rates, school graduation rates and school safety.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> We failed to reject the null hypothesis. The problem was that our data on the lottery was using the metric “Number of Lottery Retailers per 100k” in each zip code. This proved problematic because the data was heavily skewed to the right and contained outliers that were from four to seven standard deviations from the mean. These zip codes were in downtown Manhattan and had very high average incomes and low populations. Our metric of “Number of Lottery Retailers per 100k” was flawed in two ways. It did not contain that actual amount of money spent on lottery tickets. It also did not take into account that tickets might be purchased in a zip code far from where someone lives, rendering invalid our school, poverty and crimes studies. The fact that our outlier zip codes were low population wealthily areas that commuters work in reinforces this idea. For further study, it would be more valuable to see actual lottery sales. (I saw online that someone had used the “Freedom of Information Act” to request this from the New York State Lottery, but had not yet received the data.) While that would be better for study, it still does not correct for the fact that commuters quite possibly purchase a large amount of lottery tickets far from their residence. The other idea was to conduct a survey about lottery purchases. The concern for this is that people might not be entirely truthful as gambling can sometimes be viewed as a taboo subject. The other concern for this would be cost.</p>
